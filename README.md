## Aim:
 - The objective of this experiment is to demonstrate how various prompting techniques—such as query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, and answer engineering—can be employed to create high-quality content for reports, case studies, articles, or creative works.
- By examining how different prompt structures influence the content’s quality, coherence, and structure, we aim to uncover the value of structured prompting in content generation.

## Procedure:
### 1. Introduction to Prompt Patterns:
To create high-quality content, it is essential to use structured
prompting techniques. These techniques can be combined or
used independently to guide the model towards producing
content that meets specific needs.
- Key Prompt Patterns:
    - `Query Decomposition: `Breaking down complex queries into smaller, actionable parts. This technique is useful when the original query is too broad or complex to tackle at once. By dividing the query into smaller, easier to-address components, you ensure a more targeted and organized response.
    - Example:
        - `Complex Query:` "Write a business report on the global e-commerce market trends."
        - `Decomposed Queries:`
            1. "What are the current trends in the global ecommerce market?"
            2. "How has e-commerce been affected by the
            pandemic?"
            3. "What technological innovations are driving ecommerce growth?"
    - `Decision Making:` Asking the model to choose between multiple options or directions. This can be particularly helpful when exploring different aspects of a topic or when the content needs to follow a particular path.
        - `Example:` “Should the article focus on the environmental impacts or the economic effects of climate change on coastal cities? Choose one and explain why.”
    - `Answer Engineering:` Directly instructing the model on how to structure its response. This could include specifying the format (e.g., bullet points, numbered lists, paragraphs), tone (e.g., formal, informal), or any other details that guide the response’s structure.
        - `Example:` “Create an outline for an article on climate change effects, broken down into three parts: Introduction, Key Impacts (with examples), and Conclusion with actionable solutions.”
    - `Fact Check List:` To ensure factual accuracy, especially in reports and case studies, provide a list of verification points or ask the model to validate information.
        - `Example:` “Verify if the data on renewable energy adoption in Europe in 2020 is accurate, and list the sources.”
    - `Tail Generation:` Extending content logically to add depth to storytelling or analysis. After generating an initial output, ask the model to expand on certain sections to create a deeper narrative or analysis.
        - `Example:` “After explaining the startup’s success in ecommerce, provide a section on future growth projections, considering market competition and emerging technologies.”
    - `Menu Actions:` Presenting multiple options to guide the AI towards the best approach. This is useful for exploring different perspectives or focusing on a particular angle.
        - `Example:` “Choose one of the following topics to elaborate on in your article: 1) The role of AI in e-commerce growth. 2) The impact of consumer behavior changes on online shopping. 3) The future of supply chain management in e-commerce.”
    - `Semantic Filtering:` Tailoring the tone, style, and structure of the content to meet specific requirements, such as formal, academic, or creative tones. This helps ensure that the content matches the intended audience.
        - Example: “Write a formal report on market trends in the fashion industry, avoiding casual language and ensuring all statements are backed by data.”
### 2. Selecting the Content Type:
Decide on the type of content to generate based on your
interest. Possible content types include:
- `Reports:` Business reports, market trends,
sustainability reports, etc.
- `Case Studies:` Business solutions, success stories,
technological innovations.
- `Articles:` Opinion pieces, educational articles, or
research papers.
- `Creative Works:` Comic book stories, short stories,
video scripts, etc.
- For this experiment, we will choose two content types for
demonstration:
    1. Case Study on Business Success
    2. Article on Climate Change

### 3. Creating the Prompts:
1. Starting with Simple Prompts:
    - The first step is to craft basic prompts to generate initial content. These will serve as a foundation for further refinement.
    - **Case Study on Business Success:**
        - `Simple Prompt:` “Write a case study about a startup that entered the e-commerce market successfully and grew rapidly.”
    - **Article on Climate Change:**
        - `Simple Prompt:` “Write an article on the effects of climate change on coastal cities.”
2. Refining the Prompts:
    - Once you have the initial outputs, refine the prompts by adding more details or narrowing the scope of the topic. 
    - This allows you to direct the content towards more specific insights or angles.
    - **Case Study on Business Success:**
        - `Refined Prompt:` “Write a case study on a tech startup that developed a unique e-commerce platform with AIbased recommendation systems and grew its market share by 50% in 3 years.”
    - **Article on Climate Change:**
        - `Refined Prompt:` “Write a detailed article discussing the effects of climate change on coastal cities, including rising sea levels, increased storm intensity, and economic impacts, with examples from cities like Miami, New York, and Tokyo.”

### 4. Advanced Prompt Techniques:
- Introduce more advanced prompt techniques to further refine the output and provide deeper insights.
- **Case Study on Business Success:**
    - `Decision Making:` “What were the main challenges faced by the startup? Was it marketing, technology, or competition? Choose one and explain how it was overcome.”
    - `Tail Generation:` “After describing the startup’s success, extend the case study to discuss lessons learned and best practices that other startups can follow.”
- Article on Climate Change:
    - `Answer Engineering:` “Provide a structured outline for the article on climate change with the following sections: 1) Current effects of climate change on coastal cities. 2) Future predictions for sea level rise and storm intensity. 3) Solutions and government responses to mitigate these impacts.”
    - `Semantic Filtering:` “Write the article in a formal, scientific tone suitable for an academic audience, with references to studies and data from climate change research.”
### 5. Generating and Refining Outputs:
- `Case Study:` Generate the initial draft, then refine by asking the model to include specific data such as revenue increase, customer acquisition metrics, or the technological stack used by the startup.
- `Article:` After generating the first draft, refine the article by adding depth to the discussion on government actions, climate adaptation strategies, and long-term sustainability plans for coastal cities.
